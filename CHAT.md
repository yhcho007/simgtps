### The Response to Your Prompt

The reason your local AI agent didn't respond is likely due to the complexity of your request, which requires **multiple steps of reasoning and code generation**. Given the resource constraints of your CPU and the small size of the CodeGemma model, it's not surprising that it struggles with such a detailed prompt. These models are best suited for simpler, direct requests rather than multi-layered problem-solving.

Here is a Python code solution that addresses your prompt's requirements.

### The Python Chat Program Code

This solution is a command-line chat program that uses Python's `socket` library for network communication and `threading` for concurrent operations (sending and receiving data). It's designed to run on a local network.

```python
import socket
import threading
import os
import re
from typing import Dict, List, Set, Tuple

# --- Configuration ---
HOST = '0.0.0.0'
PORT = 8126  # Use a different port to avoid conflicts
DOWNLOAD_DIR = 'downloads'

# --- Global Variables ---
# Using dictionaries and sets for efficient lookups
clients: Dict[str, socket.socket] = {}
client_addresses: Dict[Tuple[str, int], str] = {}
rejected_users: Set[str] = set()
nickname: str | None = None

# --- File Transfer Helper ---
def handle_file_transfer(conn: socket.socket, file_path: str):
    """Sends a file over the socket connection."""
    file_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)
    file_name = os.path.basename(file_path)
    
    # Send file metadata
    conn.send(f"FILE_TRANSFER_START:{file_name}:{file_size}".encode('utf-8'))
    
    # Send file data in chunks
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        while True:
            chunk = f.read(1024)
            if not chunk:
                break
            conn.sendall(chunk)
    print(f"[File] '{file_name}' sent successfully.")

    """Receives a file and saves it to the downloads directory."""
    try:

        file_size = int(file_size_str)
        
        if not os.path.exists(DOWNLOAD_DIR):
            os.makedirs(DOWNLOAD_DIR)
        
        file_path = os.path.join(DOWNLOAD_DIR, file_name)

### **How to Use the Code**

1.  **Save the file:** Save the code above as a Python file, e.g., `chat_program.py`.
2.  **Run it:** Open a terminal and run `python chat_program.py`.
3.  **Connect:** Open another terminal (or have a friend run it on their PC) and use a tool like `netcat` or another instance of the script to connect. For a second instance, you'll need to run it on a different port or machine.
4.  **Commands:** Use the commands you specified:
      * `iam my_nickname` to set your name.
      * `list` to see other users.
      * `to another_user a message` to send a message.
      * `file another_user C:\path\to\file.txt` to transfer a file.
      * `reject another_user` to block a user.

This code uses basic Python libraries and runs entirely on the CPU, making it a good fit for your laptop.
